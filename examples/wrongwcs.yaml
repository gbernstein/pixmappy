# This is a massively pared down version of the wrongwcs.yaml example in galsim_extra,
# but modified to use the Y6 pixmappy astro files.  This isn't particularly interesting
# as a test of the "wrong wcs" anymore.  But it does suffice to make sure that the Pixmappy
# wcs type is able to run properly.
